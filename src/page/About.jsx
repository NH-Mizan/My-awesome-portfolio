            <p>
              I am a passionate web developer with over two years of experience in building and delivering high-quality web applications. 
              My expertise lies in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, with a strong focus on creating 
              user-friendly and responsive designs.
              <br /><br />
              I excel in converting designs from PSD, XD, XI, and Figma into pixel-perfect, fully functional HTML. 
              Throughout my career, I have successfully completed numerous projects that showcase my ability to solve 
              complex problems, deliver clean code, and contribute to the overall success of development teams.
              <br /><br />
              My goal is to continue growing as a developer, stay updated with industry trends, and contribute to 
              innovative and impactful projects.
              <br /><br />
              Feel free to connect if you&apos;re looking for someone with a proactive mindset and a passion for continuous improvement...
